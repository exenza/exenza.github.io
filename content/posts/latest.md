#Greatest and latest!

Wow... look a post for <span class="blogless_title"></span>

All I have to do is to create a "latest.md" file in "/posts/" and... that's it!

There is no local or server side logic, so is up to you to keep your files in order.<br>
That can be seen as a bad thing or good thing, to be honest, for personal project I think, less is more!
Also, it makes it hostable for free on github for example, and you can create new entries from anywhere... even the github website!

What is nice about this is that **Markdown** can be used to `format` your pages easily.<br>
> Need a quote block?

Or waht about lists?

Off course... code can be formatted too... the code below is used to use some raw HTML and embed a youtube video:
```
